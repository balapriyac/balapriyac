## Hi there! üëã

### About Me
I work on machine learning with a focus on practical applications. I enjoy reading, coding, and writing about programming and machine learning.

### üî¨ Areas of Interest
- **Natural Language Processing** - Language understanding and generation, agentic AI applications
- **Problems on Graphs** - Random walks, information diffusion, network analysis
- **Computer Vision** - Image matching, explainability, and improved feature extraction
- **Explainable AI** - Making models interpretable for real-world use cases
- **Applied ML Systems** - Building and deploying practical ML solutions

### üìà Current Focus
Working on graphs, graph algorithms and their applications. I'm particularly interested in information diffusion, network flows, and random walks on graphs.
