## Hi there! 👋

I'm Bala Priya, a developer, tech writer, and educator based in India. I work on data science, machine learning, and AI with a focus on practical applications. I also enjoy reading, coding, and writing about programming and data science.

### Areas of Interest
- **Building with LLMs** - RAG pipelines, agentic AI, and intelligent automation
- **Problems on Graphs** - Random walks, information diffusion, network analysis
- **Computer Vision** - Image matching, explainability, and improved feature extraction
- **Explainable AI** - Making models interpretable for real-world use cases
- **Applied ML Systems** - Building and deploying practical ML solutions

### Current Focus
Working on graphs and some interesting applications of random processes on graphs. I'm particularly interested in information diffusion, network flows, and random walks on graphs.
